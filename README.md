# Rideable

The module adds functionality for tokens to ride one another.

### Basic use:

To mount, select a group of tokens and press 'm' or use the 'Mount' macro while targeting(or hovering over) another token. To dismount, select all tokens you wish to dismount and press 'n' or use the "Unmount" macro. While controlling a ridden token and targeting one of its riders 'Unmount' will cause only the targeted token to dismount.

Upon mounting the module will spread the mounted tokens on the ridden token and increase their z-height relative to the ridden token. The mounted tokens will always move with the ridden token. Upon dismounting the z-height of the previously mounted tokens will be reduced again.

Ridden tokens can themself ride other tokens.

A tutorial for some of the features can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzM8pdGqYVg).

Since v2.13.0 Rideable also has a feature for Token following.

### Compatibility:

The module should be compatible with all game systems on Foundry v10 and v11, though a few features are only available for the Pf2e system. Movement modules such as the Drag Ruler (including routinglib) should work fine with the module. If you encounter any bugs please [let me know](https://github.com/Saibot393/Rideable/issues).

#### Explicit compatability:

- [routinglib](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/routinglib):
  - Additional option for world setting Following algorithm: routinglib

  - If the option "Prevent movement" for rider tokens is active, riders will be prevented from using stairways (GMs can override this)
- [Wall-Height](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/wall-height):

    - When using keys or macros to mount the attached tiles can be hovered instead of the token
    - The mounting distance will be measured from all attached tiles (only one has to be in range)
